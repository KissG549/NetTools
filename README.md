# NetTools
Network Tools to collect data from devices

The reason of these projects was to learn and practice Python programming.
Created for fun and learn Python, not recommended to use in production!!! It worked well in my environment, however there is no guarantee that this will work in yours too! Don't be stupid, use official network automation tools, like Ansible!

 - convert_for_dhcp.sh
  
    Converts input data - hostname, mac address, IP address - to monitoring system configuration.
  
 - conf-cisco and customer_script
  
    Collects informations from network devices.
